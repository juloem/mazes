# Mazes
## Introduction
"Mazes" is a maze generation library based on the book "Mazes for Programmers" by Jamis Buck [[1]](#1). The code is written in C++.

## Roadmap & TODOs
- Provide mazes with rooms
- Provide more Algorithms (Aldous-Broder, Eller's, Growing Tree, Hunt-and-Kill, Kruskal's, Recursive Backtracker, Prim's, Wilson's)
- Provide googletests
- Provide solving algorithm for the mazes (Dijkstra, A*, RRT, ...?)
