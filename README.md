# Mazes
## Introduction
"Mazes" is a maze generation library based on the book "Mazes for Programmers" by Jamis Buck [[1]](#1). The code is written in C++.

## Roadmap & TODOs
- Provide mazes with rooms
- Provide more Algorithms (Aldous-Broder, Eller's, Growing Tree, Hunt-and-Kill, Kruskal's, Recursive Backtracker, Prim's, Wilson's)
- Provide googletests
- Provide solving algorithm for the mazes (Dijkstra, A*, RRT, ...?)

## Feature: Performance Update
1. Optimize Function Calls
By using call by reference for sidewinder method "on" the computation time could be halved.
2. Compiler Optimizations
By compiling the code with optimizations enabled, the computation time could be reduced even more; to a quarter.
