# Mazes
Welcome to the Mazes project! This is a fascinating exploration into the world of maze generation algorithms. This project allows you to generate mazes of varying sizes using different algorithms, each with their unique characteristics and patterns.
The implementations in this project are based on the book "Mazes for Programmers" by Jamis Buck [[1]](#1). The code is written in C++.

## Dependencies
- [cmake >= 3.11.3](https://cmake.org/resources/)
- [make >= 4.3](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [gcc/g++ >= 11.4.0](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [libpng](https://github.com/pnggroup/libpng)

## Compiling and Running
### Compiling
To compile the project, first create build directory and change to that directory:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

From within the `build` directory, then run `cmake` as follows:
``` bash
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
### Running
The executable will be placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the project as follows:
```bash
./Mazes
```
This will generate a 5x5 maze using the Aldous-Broder algorithm by default.

You can also specify the number of rows, the number of columns, and the maze generation algorithm:
``` bash
./Mazes [number of rows] [numer of columns] [algorithm]
```
The following algorithms are available:
- `BinaryTree`: Binary Tree maze generation algorithm.
- `Sidewinder`: Sidewinder maze generation algorithm.
- `AldousBroder`: Aldous-Broder maze generation algorithm.
- `Wilsons`: Wilson's maze generation algorithm.

For example, to generate a 10x10 maze using the Sidewinder algorithm, you would run:
```bash
./Mazes 10 10 Sidewinder
```

Additionally, after running the program, a PNG image of the generated maze will be created in the `build` directory. The image file is named `maze.png`. This allows you to visually inspect the maze generated by the chosen algorithm.
